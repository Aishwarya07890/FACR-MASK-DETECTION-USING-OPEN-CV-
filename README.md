# Face Mask Detection using OpenCV and Keras

## 📝 Overview
This project implements a **Face Mask Detection** system that identifies whether a person is wearing a mask or not in real-time. It leverages deep learning models built using **Keras** for classification and **OpenCV** for real-time video processing. The system can be deployed in public areas to ensure safety and compliance with mask mandates.

## ✨ Features
- **Real-time Detection**: Detects faces and identifies mask usage in live video streams.
- **Pre-Trained Model**: Utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on labeled face mask datasets.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves high precision and recall in mask/no-mask classification.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple and intuitive interface with clear visual indicators.
- **Scalable**: Easily integrated into surveillance systems for large-scale deployment.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Programming language for implementation.
- **Keras**: Deep learning framework for building and training the classification model.
- **OpenCV**: Library for image and video processing.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For visualizing data and results.
