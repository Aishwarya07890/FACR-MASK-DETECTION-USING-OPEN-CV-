Face Mask Detection using OpenCV and Keras
Overview
This project implements a Face Mask Detection system that identifies whether a person is wearing a mask or not in real-time. It leverages deep learning models built using Keras for classification and OpenCV for real-time video processing. The system can be used in public areas to ensure safety and compliance with mask mandates.
Features
Real-time Detection: Detects faces and identifies mask usage in live video streams.
Pre-Trained Model: Utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on labeled face mask datasets.
High Accuracy: Achieves high precision and recall in mask/no-mask classification.
User-Friendly: Simple and intuitive interface with clear visual indicators.
Scalable: Can be integrated into surveillance systems for large-scale deployment.
Tools and Technologies
Python: Programming language used for implementation.
Keras: Deep learning framework for building and training the classification model.
OpenCV: Library for image and video processing.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For visualizing data and results.
